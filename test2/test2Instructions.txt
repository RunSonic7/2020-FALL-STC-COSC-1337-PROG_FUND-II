Create a class called ClassRoom.  When the object is created, the
          programmer can specify the maximum number of students that will be in
          the classroom along with the name of the class (e.g. COSC-1337.V01).
          If the programmer does not specify the number of students or the name
          of the class, the class will assign a default number of students and
          a default name of the class.

          The class should have a method called addName that will take a
          firstName, lastName and Student ID of a student (you may use structure).
          There should be a method called findName that will take a string for
          the ID number and display the first and last name of the student if
          found in the list; otherwise, return "Student not enrolled".  The
          class should have a method called display to show the name of the
          class, the number of studnets and the student names sorted by last
          name. There should be an overloaded operator (+ plus sign) where it
          will combine the number of students and the list of the students.
          So if one class has 10 students and the other class has 15 students,
          when the two classes are added together class3 = class2 + class1, the
          new class will have 35 students with the names of the students in both
          classes. (You will need to use dynamic arrays).

          Divide the class into the header and implementation files.

          Create a driver program that will test your class. Inside the main,
          create three ClassRooms.  Create 2 ClassRooms with 5 students each.
          Use the operator to add two classes into the 3rd ClassRoom.  In the
          driver, look for a name in any of the ClassRooms and test if a name
          does not exist.  Finally the driver should display the 3 ClassRooms.
          (Name of the class, number of students and the name of the students.)
          You should have the sort inside the class ClassRoom.
